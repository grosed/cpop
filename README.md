# Operators

Variables can combined together and operated on using operators. Opera-
tors are just functions. c++, like python, has a number of built in operators.

## Python operators

Here are the python operators

$+$ &nbsp; $-$ &nbsp;  $*$ &nbsp; $/$ &nbsp; $%$ &nbsp; $//$ &nbsp; $**$ &nbsp; $>$ &nbsp; $<$ &nbsp; $==$ &nbsp; $!=$ &nbsp; $>=$ &nbsp; $<=$ &nbsp; and \
or &nbsp; not &nbsp; $\&$ &nbsp; $|$ &nbsp; $~$ ^  &nbsp; $>>$ &nbsp; $<<$ &nbsp; $=$ &nbsp; $+=$ &nbsp; $-=$ &nbsp; $*=$ &nbsp; $/=$ &nbsp; \
$%=$ &nbsp; $//=$ &nbsp; $**=$ &nbsp; $\&=$ &nbsp; $|=$ &nbsp; $^=$ &nbsp; $>>=$ &nbsp; $<<=$ &nbsp; is &nbsp; in \
is &nbsp; not


## c++ operators

Here a the __c++__ operators.

$+$ &nbsp; $-$ &nbsp; $*$ &nbsp; $/$ &nbsp; $+=$ &nbsp; $-=$ &nbsp; $*=$ &nbsp; $/=$ &nbsp; $=$ &nbsp; $==$ &nbsp; $!=$ &nbsp; $\&=$ &nbsp;$|=$ &nbsp; $%=$ &nbsp; $^=$ &nbsp; $,$ \
$::$ &nbsp; $\&$ &nbsp; $\&\&$ &nbsp; $|$ &nbsp; $||$ &nbsp; $~$ ^ &nbsp; $<$ &nbsp; $<=$ &nbsp; $>$ &nbsp; $>=$ &nbsp; $<<$ &nbsp; $>>$ &nbsp; $%$ &nbsp; $++$ &nbsp; $--$

Some of these operators are unary (takes a value, returns a new value), some
are binary (takes two values, returns a new value). Which ones are which ?
c++ also has the ternary operator ? :.

#### Exercise 1

Start a new __sos__ kernel and write a __python__ program and corresponding __c++__ program to explore what
the operators do. Use your programs to find out which operators are _binary_
and which are _unary_. Operators can be _right or left associative_. What does
this mean ? Find a _right associative_ __c++__ operator. Find a _left associative_
__c++__ operator. What happens if you mix the type of the variables in __c++__
operators ?
